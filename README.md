 # go-app-playground

`go-app-playground` is my playground implementation in Go. It shows how I implement it as an example here.

## What will be included?

TBD but...

- A single binary with subcommands and with effient Docker build
- Everything is `context`-aware
- Concurrent SQS worker
- HTTP API powered by https://github.com/go-chi/chi (my favarite of choice as of today)
- Lambda function via SNS (webhook to SNS router)
- Slack integration
